Language-agnostic shorthand notation for representing the type and 
structure of data in documented code as clearly and efficiently as 
possible.

# READ THIS FIRST (Introduction)
Universal Data Shorthand (UDatS) is a shorthand notation for representing the structure
of the data in your programs. UDatS is intended to be used in to communicate patterns 
(like how many times a given type is allowed to occur in a container, more on that later),
and to shorten lengthy documentation of return types, parameters or whatever you need to 
only a few words.

This project does not, and most likely never will, provide any actual code. UDatS is simply
a format for you to integrate into your documentation.

## Note on the word *Universal*
The word *Universal*, does NOT mean that all HUMANS will understand
UDatS, if you include it in your documentation. I would highly reccomend
linking to this repository in the beginning of your documentation, to
clear up confusion.
